# Cross-Chain-Rebase-Token
Cross Chain Rebase Token is an ERC-20 token with per-user rebasing interest. Users earn linear interest over time, calculated on each interaction. The global interest rate can only decrease. Built with OpenZeppelin and Solidity, it's designed for vaults, staking, and cross-chain DeFi use cases.
